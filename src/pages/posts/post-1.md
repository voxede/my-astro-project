# My firts Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a website.

# What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blo Posts**: This is my first blog post! I noew have Astro pages and MArkdown posts!

# What's next

I will finish the astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more come.
